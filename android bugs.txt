1.Android:allowBackup=false flag is missing.


Description:

The android:allowBackup attribute defines whether application data can be backed up and restored by a user who has enabled usb debugging. If backup flag is set to true, it allows an attacker to take the backup of the application data via adb even if the device is not rooted. Therefore applications that handle and store sensitive information such as card details, passwords etc. should have this setting explicitly set to false because by default it is set to true to prevent such risks.

Remediation

Define android:allowBackup="false" in androidmanifest.xml file.

<application
android:allowBackup=”false”
</application>
